<analysis>original_problem_statement:
The user wants to create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot application.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Frontend:** Recreate a pixel-perfect, responsive clone of a chatbot interface from two Axure prototypes:
    *   Homepage: 
    *   Chat History: 
2.  **Backend:**
    *   Use Django as the web framework.
    *   Implement a RAG pipeline using a remote Ollama instance ().
    *   Use the  model for response generation.
    *   Use the  model for creating embeddings.
    *   Use Qdrant as the vector database.
    *   Use PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing chat history and metadata.
3.  **Documentation & Deployment:**
    *   Create a comprehensive  detailing functional features, tech stack, and technical documentation.
    *   Create a full Docker setup (, , Nginx) for seamless deployment.
    *   Create a  file.
    *   Push the entire project to the user's GitHub repository: .
4.  **New Feature: Analytics Dashboard:**
    *   Create a new dashboard page with two tabs:
        *   **Tab 1:** Display usage metrics.
        *   **Tab 2:** Display statistical information about RAG performance.
    *   Capture detailed performance data for each chat message (e.g., Qdrant query time, LLM response time).

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack RAG chatbot application has been successfully built. The frontend is a React application that accurately clones the provided prototypes. The backend is a Django application that uses a remote Ollama instance for both text generation () and embeddings (), with Qdrant for vector search and PostgreSQL for data storage. The entire application is containerized with Docker and documented in a comprehensive . The code has also been pushed to the user's GitHub repository.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Implementing the backend for the new Analytics Dashboard feature. The agent updated the  model in Django to include fields for performance metrics (, , ) and created new API endpoints (, ) to expose this data. It started modifying the  view to capture this data but has not yet completed the full implementation of the timing logic.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? both
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding issues or bugs. The current work is a new feature implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete the Analytics Dashboard Feature (P0)
  - **Where to resume**:
    1.  **Backend:** In , within the  function, complete the logic to accurately calculate , , and . Save these values to the  instance before saving it to the database.
    2.  **Backend:** Run  and  to apply the changes to the  model in the PostgreSQL database.
    3.  **Frontend:** Create a new route  in .
    4.  **Frontend:** Create a new component .
    5.  **Frontend:** In , implement the UI with two tabs. Fetch data from the  and  endpoints and display it using charts (e.g., from  or a similar library).
  - **What will be achieved with this?**: A comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into application usage and the performance of the RAG pipeline.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
  - **Blocked on something**: No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming or future tasks requested by the user.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Clone**: A pixel-perfect, responsive React frontend was created based on the user's Axure prototypes.
- **Backend RAG Pipeline**: A Django backend was built with a complete RAG architecture.
- **Technology Stack Migration**:
    - The backend framework was changed from FastAPI to Django as requested.
    - The embedding model was upgraded from  to  via a remote Ollama service.
    - Django was upgraded to version 5.2.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: The React frontend was successfully connected to the Django backend APIs, replacing all mock data.
- **Remote LLM Integration**: The application was configured to use a remote Ollama instance for both embeddings and chat generation, including increasing the Gunicorn timeout to handle cold starts.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive  was created, detailing the architecture, setup, tech stack, and API endpoints. It was subsequently updated with all the new technology changes.
- **Dockerization**: A complete Docker deployment environment was created, including Dockerfiles for frontend and backend, a , an Nginx reverse proxy configuration, and a Makefile.
- **Git Push**: A  file was created, and the entire project was successfully pushed to the user's specified GitHub repository () using a Personal Access Token.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues, such as local Ollama memory constraints and Gunicorn timeouts, were successfully resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Full-Stack**: React frontend with a Django backend.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The core architecture for the chatbot.
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant is used for storing document embeddings and performing similarity searches.
- **LLM Integration**: A remote Ollama instance is used for both embeddings () and response generation ().
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose are used to orchestrate the entire application stack (frontend, backend, Nginx, Qdrant, PostgreSQL).
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to serve the frontend and route API requests to the Django backend.

**key DB schema**
- **table_name**: 
  -  (CharField)
  -  (TextField)

**changes in tech stack**
- The backend was migrated from the initial **FastAPI** template to **Django 5.2**.
- The embedding process was migrated from a local **** model to using the **** model via a remote Ollama instance.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The application relies on a remote Ollama instance at . Ensure this service is reachable.
- The Gunicorn timeout has been increased to  in  to handle potential cold starts from the remote LLM. This setting is also reflected in the Docker setup.
- When resuming the current task, remember to run Django database migrations (, ) after completing the backend changes to apply the new model fields.
- The embedding model () has a dimension of 768. The Qdrant collection  is configured for this dimension.
